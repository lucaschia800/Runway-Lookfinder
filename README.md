Repo for some of the work done for my Runway-Lookfinder App.

Iterations and training/testing for many models were left out and as work environments changed from colab to gcp to hyak klone @ UW leading to non essential work being left behind. The focus was on moving the scripts pertaining to training/benchmarking which was the focus during earlier stages of development. 

The result were: a clip model capable of returning clothing matches based off of a natural language query allowing for a user to search through a catalogue of runway images through NL, a series of object detection models capable of identifying 10 different classes, and a series of encoders outputting embeddings of images for similarity comparison.
