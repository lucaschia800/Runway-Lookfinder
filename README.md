Repo for some of the work done for my Runway-Lookfinder App.

Iterations and training/testing for many models were left out and as work environments changed from colab to gcp to hyak klone @ UW leading to non essential work being left behind. The focus was on moving the scripts pertaining to training/benchmarking which was the focus during earlier stages of development.
